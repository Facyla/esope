Tasks
-----

This plugin will allow you to create and manage tasks in the Elgg Way:

- Create your tasks : Title, description, start, end, %done, remaining work, assign, tags, categorie tags, read access, write access.
- Create Group tasks: The task belong to the group.
- Manage tasks: Modify start, end, %done, remaining, assign, comments
- Widget tasks: Liste task visible to you
- Comment tasks: Just add a comment.
- Assign task to members of the group
- Notification: As the bookmark system.
- Calendar dates multi-language (jquery ui i18n date picker)
- French and English translations.

You can customize the status lists and type list by simply editing your translation file.

Further dev: quick input widget, task filter.
