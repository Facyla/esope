WARNING : this is an intermediate version of event_calendar :
 - mostly based on previous version
 - integrates some changes from next version to correct some bugs
 - keeps the functionnalities and look of previous version

Event_calendar needs a quick patch for group page_handler : arguments passed to event_calendar_activated_for_group($group) are a GUID or an ElggGroup. Add in lib/model.php :
	// Facyla : patch suggested for quick workaround for group page_handler : refused yet
	if (!elgg_instanceof($group, 'group')) $group = get_entity($group);
