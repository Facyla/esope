Changelog
=========

1.10.5
------

- Reset option added (allows removal of all given votes on a poll; permission for resetting is given to admins and optionally also poll owners by a new Poll plugin settings option),
- Usage of Elgg's default delete icon instead of custom icon,
- composer.json added.

1.10.4
------

- Updated version 1.9.4 for Elgg 1.10/1.11.

1.9.4
------

- Updated version 1.8.4 for Elgg 1.9.
And:
- Removal of mod/poll/everyone.php (I believe this file is no longer necessary as a user should be directed to it anymore - if I'm wrong and you get issues by the file missing please tell me),
- Add remaining inline script element JS code to AMD module.

1.8.4
-----

- Total reset of votes when editing a poll (adding/removing choices or modifying existing choices). Problem was that users who already voted were unable to re-vote after poll choices had been changed. This could have been quite annoying for them if they wanted to change their vote based on the updated choices (a mischievous person would have even been able to switch the choices to contradict the poll results completely!). The only way to make it fair seemed to me to reset the votes to allow everyone a re-vote. Downside is that even correcting a typo in a poll choice text will reset the poll but his is unavoidable unfortunately,
- Fixed bug where poll choices of a group poll got lost when poll was edited by the group admin but the poll is owned by another group member,
- Fixed bug that prevented the description of a poll to be completely removed.

1.10.3
------

- Updated version 1.9.3 for Elgg 1.9.
