Survey plugin for Elgg 1.12
==========================

This plugin is forked from Poll plugin 1.10.2.
Some of the implementation ideas also come from knowledge_database plugin from Facyla, with insights from Evan Winslow proposal at https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg/issues/6808

This plugin has a different aim than "poll", and is not backward-compatible. In fact, both plugin can be enabled and used at the same time to provide simple polls and more complex surveys.

Survey plugin provides survey features such as:
 - multiple questions,
 - extended set of available question types (notation, free text, multiple choices, etc.)
 - nice results views, and results filtering, per question and per responder
 - CSV results export
It is intended to admins and optionally group admins rather than to simple members.

This plugin allows adding of polls (both site-wide polls and optionally also group-specific polls). The number of choices to vote on is free to choose for each poll. Optionally, a (longer) description can be added to a poll. An admin can also (optionally) make a single poll the site's current featured poll. The widgets included are a "My polls" widget that shows a user's polls on his profile page and/or dashboard, a "Latest community polls" widget for the dashboard (and if the Widget Manager plugin is available also on the index page), a group's polls widget for group profile pages and the "Featured poll" widget showing the site's current featured poll on the dashboard (and if the Widget Manager plugin is available also on the index page). Notification on creation of new polls is optional (admin setting) and the creation of river entries for new polls and voting on polls can also be enabled/disabled in the plugin settings.

The poll plugin has a long history (see below), has been released in various versions by different developers and a few word about the compatibility of this new release of the poll plugin seem necessary. Basically, there exist two classes of the "poll" plugin (or "polls" plugin respectively): most of the versions are based quite closely on the original version of the "poll" plugin by John Mellberg. Each of them is compatible to the other versions of the "poll" plugin regarding existing polls but there is quite a mess regarding compatibilty to Elgg itself (at maximum Elgg 1.7 anyway). The other class consists actually only of the "polls" plugin of Kevin Jardine. The polls plugin of Kevin is a complete re-write, works also on Elgg 1.8 but is not compatible with the other poll plugins.

With this new release I've tried to merge the two classes of the poll(s) plugin again. While it's based on Kevin's polls plugin I've renamed it again to poll plugin, tried to fix the remaining issues and also included an upgrade script for existing polls created with any former version of the poll plugin.
