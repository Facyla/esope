# Plugin template

This plugin provides a basic template to start setting up a plugin

To get started, replace all "plugin_template" occurrences with your plugin name. You should do this both in file structure, and inside the theme plugin files content (so choose carefully, and avoid using the same name as another plugin).

Then customize the manifest file.

Now you're done and can tweak your plugin !

To do so, edit the main files :
- views/default/theme_template/css.php for plugin CSS styles

- pages/plugin_template/example_page.php to set up a custom plugin homepage
