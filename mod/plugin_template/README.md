# plugin_template

This plugin provides a basic template to start developping a new plugin

To get started :
1. Copy this plugin.
2. Choose carefully your plugin name (avoid using the same name as an existing plugin) and rename it
3. Search and replace all "plugin_template" occurrences in folders with your plugin name
4. Search and replace all "plugin_template" occurrences in script files content with your plugin name
5. Customise the manifest.xml file


Now you're done and can tweak your plugin !

To do so, edit the main files :
- start.php
- views/default/theme_template/css.php for plugin CSS styles
- pages/plugin_template/index.php for a displayed page

When possible, take a nice screenshot and copy it to graphics/screenshot.png
