Webshim
=======

Adds the [Webshim](http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/index.html) library to your Elgg site to reliably use HTML5 features across browsers, even if native support is lacking.

Adds HTML5 Forms support by default if enabled. Override the /webshim/head view to extend it with other Webshim features.
