<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-default\">Default</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;It is not precisely an access level by itself, but the <strong>access level that is set by default</strong> on the site (or in a group) for any new content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-public\">Public</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;Any public content is <strong>viewable by anyone</strong>. This includes any site visitor, even non-members and not logged in people : there is no need to have an account or to log in the site to have access to it. A public content is also readable and potentially indexed by search engines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-members\">Site members</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;This publication is viewable by <strong>all and any site members</strong>, which means any person who has an account on this site. Search engines do not have access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-group\">Group</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;This publication is viewable only by the members of a <strong>particular group</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-collection\">Liste de contacts</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;La publication est visible par les membres d'une <strong>liste de contacts</strong>. Chaque membre peut cr&eacute;er ses propres listes de contacts, qui sont strictement personnelles (pour une liste partag&eacute;e, il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable d'utiliser un groupe).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-friends\">Friends</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;This publication is viewable only by the <strong>friends of the author</strong>.</td>

<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-private\">Private / draft</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;This publication is viewable <strong>only by you</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class=\"elgg-access elgg-access-public elgg-access-limited\">Limited</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;Only in walled garden mode: when the site is configured as an \"intranet\", the \"Public\" access level is replaced by \"Limited\" : only logged in users will have access to the content. Practically, this is an equivalent for \"Site Members\".</td>
