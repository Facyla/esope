Widget Title
---------------------------
To change the widget title, edit the language file (en.php) and change the 
string 'simplepie:widget' from 'RSS Feed' to whatever you desire.


Proxy Server
----------------------------
If your site is going through a proxy server to get to the feeds, you may 
want to increase the timeout on the feeds (though this is unlikely as the 
default timeout is 10 seconds). You can do this by editing 
simplepie/views/default/widgets/feed_reader/content.php. There you can just
uncomment the line $feed->set_timeout(20);


HTML tags in feeds
--------------------------
The widget allows the following tags: `<a><p><br><b><i><em><del><pre><strong><ul><ol><li><img>`.
Other tags are stripped to avoid problems with the display of your site.


Library version and patches
--------------------------
Plugin currently uses 1.3.1 Simplepie version.
There is a bug that prevents curl from fetching some HTTPS feeds, so this version integrates a patch detailed in https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues/236 : lines 4469-4470 :
				// ESOPE patch : enables fetching SSL feeds - see https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues/236
				curl_setopt($fp, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
