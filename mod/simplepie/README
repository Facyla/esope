# Simplepie plugin
This plugin wraps the Simplepie library and offers several features :
 * RSS feed widget : easy to use
 * group feed module : set $group->feed_url to use. Full syntax also allows to set feed title with: FEED URL::FEED TITLE
 * reusable RSS feed views : for developpers and theme integrators


## Widget Title
To change the widget title, add the following string in your theme plugin language file, and change the translation to whatever you desire :
	'simplepie:widget' => "RSS Feed",


## Group feed
Group fields values are usually made available through profile_manager plugin. Any other mean to set this metadata actually works.
The proposed group module can be displayed in the group by extending the chosen view with simplepie/group_simplepie_module
An alternate view is specifically designed for inclusion into group sidebar: simplepie/sidebar_simplepie_module


## Reusable views
The generic RSS feed reader view is simplepie/feed_reader and is called with e.g.:
	elgg_view('simplepie/feed_reader', array('feed_url' => $feed, 'excerpt' => false, 'num_items' => 5, 'post_date' => true));
Direct parameters are :
	excerpt : include item excerpt, default TRUE
	post_date : include item post date, default TRUE
	num_items : number of items to show, default 5


## Proxy Server
If your site is going through a proxy server to get to the feeds, you may 
want to increase the timeout on the feeds (though this is unlikely as the 
default timeout is 10 seconds). You can do this by editing 
simplepie/views/default/widgets/feed_reader/content.php. There you can just
uncomment the line $feed->set_timeout(20);


## HTML tags in feeds
The widget allows the following tags: `<a><p><br><b><i><em><del><pre><strong><ul><ol><li><img>`.
Other tags are stripped to avoid problems with the display of your site.


## IMPORTANT NOTICE : Library version and patches
Plugin currently uses 1.3.1 Simplepie version.
