# Adds Twitter Bootstrap to Elgg

Use this plugin if you want to use Twitter Bootstrap as a base for your own theme.
It is meant for theme developpers who wish to use some (or all) of Twitter Bootstrap elements.

Please not that enabling Bootstrap will update a bunch of default styles, so you will certainly have to adapt your style after enabling it !



## @TODO
- provide ready-to-use bootstrap pageshells
- provide ready-to-use bootstrap layouts
- provide ready-to-use bootstrap templates (views)
