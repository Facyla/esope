	<description>CMSPages is flexible CMS tool for Elgg, and turns Elgg into a full CMS, and enables it to act as a website, even when unsed in walled garden mode. It provides static pages, but also reusable views, content generator modules, and dynamic templates that can be used for interface-building and site pages management. You should enable it if you need to create site-wide pages such as Credits, Legal notice, but also to build a full public website using a navigation menu and external widgets.</description>

======================
INSTALLATION
======================
- Place in mod directory
- Enable plugin
- Go to admin pages
- Check Cmspages in admin menu entry and enjoy (inline help)

======================
NOTES
======================
- Admins can allow non-admin users to use that tool (see plugin settings)
- CMS Pages can be used to generate static pages :
  * interface pages with formatted text & images : eg. about, credits, contacts, etc.
  * unfiltered HTML pages to embed multimedia content such as videos, iframes, Twitter widget, etc.
- CMS Pages can also be used to generate dynamic views, which can be used to build a configurable interface :
  * login page information, footer links, header image and text...
  * configurable zones inserted in layout, eg. introduction in group presentation
- CMS Pages supports templating :
  * views can be called recursively from other CMS Pages using {{pagetype}} calls
  * acts as a template & content furnisher for externalblogs
- CMS Pages supports configurable modules :
  * blocks can be generated using custom parameters :
  * available modules = generate group, user, object lists, search results, view a specific entity, etc.
- CMS Pages is aware of context : display can be filtered depending of context (useful to hide a sidebar or specific modules when used in template mode)
- one can also specify if a given cmspage can be rendered in a page, as a view, or both (blocks templating or out-of-context rendering)
- In walled-garden, public CMS Pages are made publicly available (if not wanted : change access rights)


======================
Version History
======================

@TODO :
  - import export cmspage(s)
  - presets and models
  - add ids on each cmspage
  - auto adjust editor size to content length



0.9.9.2 RC0 (2015.04.01) - This version is a release candidate
  - Integration with elgg_menus (allows to override categories menu with a custom menu)
  - Full control over pages header, menu and footer

0.9.9.1 (2015.03.28)
  - admin interface
  - enable password access for any page or view

0.9.9.0 (2015.03.25)

0.9.8 (2013.11.19)
  - list used templates for a given cmspage
  - templates can also add the visual editor (disabled by default)
  - Allow to define a custom template per cmspages display (using a custom cmspages template). Templates themselves can't use it. Its purpose is to use cmspages in custom layouts, with sidebar, widgets, etc.

0.9.7 (2013.09.18)
  - Allow embedding cmspage content only (same as view, but through an read URL).
  - Usage for "soft" embed (HTML only, no style): add ?embed=true (or any value for param "embed"). This is convenient for lightbox/popup use.

  - added some documentation above..

0.9.2 (2012.11.29)
  - added proof-of-concept of producing an embeddable content out of an intranet ; currently with a hard-coded group activity widget => make this configurable, and maybe an independant plugin (make_embed) ?
