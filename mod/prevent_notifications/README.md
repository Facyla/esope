# Prevent notifications
Lets user define if a new publication should trigger notifications or not

This plugins adds a special field in content creation forms that allows editors to block outgoing notification.

Admins can define default behaviour : notify, block, or force user choice (required field).

It also presets the notification setting to "no" when embedding content (eg. embed a file in a blog article).


## Technical note
This works by passing a special parameter that basically tells "don't notify anyone" when a new objet is created. The notification process is blocked and **no one** shoud receive anything. 
Exceptions might happen for plugins which do not use the notification queue nor the notifications-related hooks, eg. a plugin that makes a direct call in its action to an email sending function that does not trigger any hook.

Supported object types : blog, bookmarks, brainstorm, discussion, event_calendar, file, file_tools, pages, videos

To support new object types, update your form and add the next line just above the submit button:
    if (!$vars['entity']) { echo elgg_view('prevent_notifications/prevent_form_extend', array()); }
