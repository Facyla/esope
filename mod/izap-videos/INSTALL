## Server settings for large videos of 200Mb

Suppose we want to setup izap_videos for a 200Mb video. Follow me step by step. I think, this would increase the successful installation rate.

1. Install elgg 1.8 and install izap-elgg-bridge 2.1 and izap-videos 4.1b or greater. You can find izap-elgg-bridge 2.1 at [izap-elgg-bridge 2.1](http://www.pluginlotto.com/store/product/tarun/7551/izapelggbridge-21]).
2. Locate izap-videos plugin from admin panel and click on "more info" link to find out if all dependencies are fine.
3. Now let's set it up for 200 Mb videos. Click on "Settings" tab and change "Enter max file size (in Mb.)" to 200.
4. Now edit ".htaccess" file. You can find it in root path of your elgg installation. And find "php_value" you will be redirected to section we need to update. Set values as follows:
  * php_value memory_limit 200M
  * php_value register_globals 0
  * php_value post_ max_size 200M
  * php_value upload_max_filesize 200M
  * php_value display_errors 0
  * php_value max_execution_time 0
  * php_value max_input_time 0
5. Ok so we have done. Here on my machine, every thing is working fine. I just uploaded 146Mb video. and queue is working to encode it to .flv
