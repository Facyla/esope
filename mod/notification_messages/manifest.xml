Notes : 
 * This plugin is inspired by former plugin notification_messages for Elgg 1.6 (discontinued due to API changes)
 * Developped after an initial PR on html_email_handler to add a hook to change subject 
 *   (same as notify:entity:message core hook, but for subjects)
 * Used hook is implemented in advanced_notifications (by Coldtrick) / and this html_email_handler version
