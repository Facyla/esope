Listing of unvalidated users
============================

In the Admin section of the website is a list of all unvalidated users. Some actions can be taken on the users, like delete them from the system
or validate them.

Plugins have the option to add additional features to this list.

.. seealso::

	An example of this is the :doc:`/plugins/uservalidationbyemail` plugin which doesn't allow users onto the website until their e-mail address 
	is validated.
